# TimeGlyd

## Description

TimeGlyd is a small, swift, secure, and offline-friendly utility app designed for distributed teams. It leverages technologies such as [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), and [Lunr.js](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js) to achieve a smaller and all-offline experience. 

TimeGlyd helps remote teams navigate time zones with ease and privacy. The app runs entirely offline, doesn't make any SQL calls, and doesn't collect any data. TimeGlyd is your invisible and trustworthy companion in the world of remote work.

- Regular updates: The app is constantly improving based on user feedback. Your needs shape the future updates of TimeGlyd.
- Ultra-lightweight: Weighing just 10MB, TimeGlyd is a feather-light yet mighty force compared to the bulky ~200MB electron apps. It provides more efficiency with less storage.
